# Built-in validation rules

Below tables contain statements from [RFC7643](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7643) 
and [RFC7644](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7644) (sometimes redacted, to make them easier to understand without the full context).
For every statement there is an information if a particular desired behavior is somehow validated or / and if
some implementation that ensures the constraint is provided. The :heavy_check_mark: symbol means that
the desired behavior is validated / ensured by the implementation. The :x: symbol means the opposite. No symbol means the
statement is irrelevant in the context of validation / support.

!!! info
    `scimpler` provides stateless validations and operations, so many of below desired behaviors are not
    covered, and it is up to the service provider / provisioning client implementer to make sure
    everything is set correctly. You are free to use the tables as a checklist!

| Each SCIM resource has a resource type (`meta.resourceType` attribute) that defines the resource's core attribute schema and any attribute extension schema, as well as the endpoint where objects of the same type may be found.                                                                        | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| The `schemas` attribute is a required attribute and is an array of Strings containing URIs that are used to indicate the namespaces of the SCIM schemas that define the attributes present in the current JSON structure.                                                                                | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |

| Service provider support for HTTP PATCH may be discovered by querying the service provider configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |        :x:         | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Because SCIM resource identifiers are assigned by the service provider, HTTP PUT **MUST NOT** be used to create new resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |        :x:         |        :x:         |
| As the PUT operation's intent is to replace all attributes, SCIM clients **MAY** send all attributes, regardless of each attribute's mutability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |

| In the PUT request, if one or more values are already set for an `immutable` attribute, the input value(s) **MUST** match, or HTTP status code 400 **SHOULD** be returned with a `scimType` error code of `mutability`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |        :x:         |        :x:         |
| In the PUT request, for `immutable` attribute(s), if the service provider has no existing values, the new value(s) **SHALL** be applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |        :x:         |        :x:         |

| HTTP PATCH is an OPTIONAL server function that enables clients to update one or more attributes of a SCIM resource using a sequence of operations to `add`, `remove`, or `replace` values. Clients may discover service provider support for PATCH by querying the service provider configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |        :x:         | :heavy_check_mark: |
| The body of each HTTP PATCH request **MUST** contain the `schemas` attribute with the URI value of `urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | :heavy_check_mark: |        :x:         |
| The body of an HTTP PATCH request **MUST** contain the attribute `Operations`, whose value is an array of one or more PATCH operations. Each PATCH operation object **MUST** have exactly one `op` member, whose value indicates the operation to perform and **MAY** be one of `add`, `remove`, or `replace`.                                                                                                                                                                                           | :heavy_check_mark: |        :x:         |
| In the PATCH request, the `path` attribute value is a String containing an attribute path describing the target of the operation. The `path` attribute is OPTIONAL for `add` and `replace` and is REQUIRED for `remove` operations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | :heavy_check_mark: |        :x:         |
| In the PATCH request, the `path` attribute is described by the ABNF syntax rule:<br>```PATH = attrPath / valuePath [subAttr]```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Each PATCH operation against an attribute **MUST** be compatible with the attribute's mutability and schema. For example, a client **MUST NOT** modify an attribute that has mutability `readOnly` or `immutable`. However, a client **MAY** `add` a value to an `immutable` attribute if the attribute had no previous value. An operation that is not compatible with an attribute's mutability or schema **SHALL** return the appropriate HTTP response status code and a JSON detail error response. | :heavy_check_mark: |        :x:         |
| For multi-valued attributes, a PATCH operation that sets a value's `primary` sub-attribute to `true` **SHALL** cause the server to automatically set `primary` to `false` for any other values in the array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        :x:         |        :x:         |
| The PATCH request, regardless of the number of operations, **SHALL** be treated as atomic.  If a single operation encounters an error condition, the original SCIM resource **MUST** be restored, and a failure status **SHALL** be returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |        :x:         |        :x:         |

| On successful completion, the server either **MUST** return a 200 OK response code and the entire resource within the response body, subject to the `attributes` query parameter, or MAY return HTTP status code 204 (No Content) and the appropriate response headers for a successful PATCH request. The server **MUST** return a 200 OK if the `attributes` parameter is specified in the request.                                                                                                    | :heavy_check_mark: |        :x:         |
| The PATCH `add` operation **MUST** contain a `value` member whose content specifies the value to be added. The value **MAY** be a quoted value, or it may be a JSON object containing the sub-attributes of the complex attribute specified in the operation's `path`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | :heavy_check_mark: |        :x:         |

| The `failOnErrors` attribute is an integer specifying the number of errors that the service provider will accept before the operation is terminated and an error response is returned. OPTIONAL in the request. Not valid in a response.                                                                                                                                                       |           |             |
| The `Operations` attribute defines operations within a bulk job. Each operation corresponds to a single HTTP request against a resource endpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |           |             |
| The `Operations.method` sub-attribute is the HTTP method of the current operation. Possible values are `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`. REQUIRED.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |           |             |
| The `Operations.bulkId` sub-attribute is the transient identifier of a newly created resource, unique within a bulk request and created by the client. REQUIRED when `Operations.method` is POST.                                                                                                                                                                                              |           |             |
| The `Operations.version` sub-attribute is the current resource version. Version **MAY** be used if the service provider supports entity-tags and `Operations.method` is `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`.                                                                                                                                                                                           |           |             |
| The `Operations.path` sub-attribute is the resource's relative path to the SCIM service provider's root. If `Operations.method` is `POST`, the value must specify a resource type endpoint, e.g., `/Users` or `/Groups`, whereas all other `Operations.method` values must specify the path to a specific resource, e.g. `/Users/2819c223-7f76-453a-919d-413861904646`. REQUIRED in a request. |           |             |
| The `Operations.data` sub-attribute is the resource data as it would appear for a single SCIM POST, PUT, or PATCH operation. REQUIRED in a request when `Operations.method` is `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH`.                                                                                                                                                                                      |           |             |
| The `Operations.location` sub-attribute is the resource endpoint URL. REQUIRED in a response, except in the event of a POST failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |           |             |
| The `Operations.response` sub-attribute is the HTTP response body for the specified request operation. When indicating a response with an HTTP status other than a 200-series response, the response body **MUST** be included. For normal completion, the server **MAY** elect to omit the response body.                                                                                     |           |             |
| The `Operations.status` sub-attribute is the HTTP response status code for the requested operation. When indicating an error, the `Operations.response` sub-attribute **MUST** contain the details error response.                                                                                                                                                                             |           |             |
| If a bulk job is processed successfully, HTTP response code 200 OK MUST be returned; otherwise, an appropriate HTTP error code MUST be returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |           |             |
| The service provider **MUST** continue performing as many changes as possible and disregard partial failures. The client **MAY** override this behavior by specifying a value for the `failOnErrors` attribute. The "failOnErrors" attribute defines the number of errors that the service provider should accept before failing the remaining operations returning the response.              |           |             |
| To be able to reference a newly created resource, the `bulkId` attribute **MAY** be specified when creating new resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |           |             |
| The `bulkId` is defined by the client as a surrogate identifier in a POST operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |           |             |
| The service provider **MUST** return the same `bulkId` together with the newly created resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |           |             |
| The `bulkId` can then be used by the client to map the service provider id with the `bulkId` of the created resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |           |             |
| The service provider **MUST** replace `bulkId` with the permanent resource id once created.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |           |             |
| A SCIM service provider **MAY** elect to optimize the sequence of operations received (e.g., to improve processing performance). When doing so, the service provider **MUST** ensure that the client's intent is preserved and the same stateful result is achieved as for non-optimized processing.                                                                                           |           |             |
| The service provider **MUST** try to resolve circular cross-references between resources in a single bulk job but MAY stop after a failed attempt and instead return HTTP status code 409 (Conflict).                                                                                                                                                                                          |           |             |
| Extensions that include references to other resources **MUST** be handled in the same way by the service provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |           |             |
| The service provider MUST define the maximum number of operations and maximum payload size a client may send in a single request. These limits MAY be retrieved from the service provider configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                       |           |             |
| If either limit is exceeded, the service provider MUST return HTTP response code 413 (Payload Too Large).  The returned response MUST specify the limit exceeded in the body of the error response.                                                                                                                                                                                            |           |             |

| For implementations where a client is associated with more than one Tenant, the service provider MAY use one of the three methods for explicit specification of the Tenant: 1. A URL prefix: `https://www.example.com/Tenants/{tenant_id}/v2/Users`, 2. A sub-domain: `https://{tenant_id}.example.com/v2/Groups`, 3. An HTTP header.                   |           |             |
| The service provider may choose to implement SCIM ids that are unique across all resources for all Tenants, but this is not required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |           |             |
| The `externalId`, defined by the client, is required to be unique ONLY within the resources associated with the associated Tenant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |           |             |

| A SCIM client MUST NOT generate `userinfo` component when `http` URI reference is generated with a message.                                                                                                                                                                                      |           |             |
| SCIM clients MUST require the use of TLS mechanism when communicating with SCIM service providers.                                                                                                                                                                                               |           |             |
| The SCIM service provider MUST support TLS 1.2 and MAY support additional transport-layer mechanisms meeting its security requirements.                                                                                                                                                          |           |             |
| When using TLS, the client MUST perform a TLS/SSL server identity check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |           |             |
| Bearer tokens and cookies MUST contain sufficient entropy to prevent a random guessing attack.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |           |             |
| Bearer tokens and cookies MUST be exchanged using TLS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |           |             |
| Bearer tokens MUST have a limited lifetime that can be determined directly or indirectly by the service provider.                                                                                                                                                                                |           |             |
| In OAuth 2.0, a client MAY use OAuth token refresh to obtain a new bearer token after authenticating to an authentication server.                                                                                                                                                                |           |             |
| An HTTP cookie SHOULD last no longer than the lifetime of a browser session. An expiry time should be set that limits session cookie lifetime.                                                                                                                                                   |           |             |
| SCIM clients requesting information using query filters that use HTTP GET SHOULD give consideration to the information content of the filters and whether or not their exposure in a URI would represent a breach of security or confidentiality through leakage in web browsers or server logs. |           |             |
| For information that is legally considered "personally identifiable information", clients SHOULD query using HTTP POST.                                                                                                                                                                          |           |             |
| Servers that receive HTTP GET requests using filters that contain sensitive or confidential personal information SHOULD respond with HTTP status code 403. A `scimType` error code of `sensitive` may be returned to indicate that the request must be submitted using POST.                     |           |             |
| For anonymous requests, the service provider MAY try to authenticate web user interface components that formulate the SCIM creation request (e.g. CAPTCHA).                                                                                                                                      |           |             |
| For anonymous requests, the service provider MAY limit the number of requests that any particular client MAY make in a period of time.                                                                                                                                                           |           |             |
| For anonymous requests, for User resources, the service provider MAY default newly created resources with an `active` setting of `false`, and use a secondary confirmation process (e.g., email confirmation) to ensure that the resource created is real.                                       |           |             |
| Service providers SHOULD follow recommendations outlined in RFC6819 for secure storage and handling of sensitive data.                                                                                                                                                                           |           |             |
| Service providers SHOULD define an access control model that differentiates between individual client applications and their specific need to access information, and any User self-service rights to review and update personal profile information.                                            |           |             |
